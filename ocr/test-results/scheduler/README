This directory contains the test results of MultiGet support

For each scenario MSGSTATS and Energy Stats are collected.  Testing uses CoMD, RSBench, and fft.

    case 1: Shared PD w/L1 & L2 Allocation
    case 2: XE_MULTIGET & CE_MULTIGET:
    case 3: SPAWN QUEUE

Directory structure:

Under each application directory, there are 10 sub-directories and 5 csv files.
Directory and file names are long, but contain the configuration information. For example,
"install_c4_msgstats_pd_1_xe_1_ce_0_4d" is the install/tg/logs directory of the
msg stats collected for test case 4 (c4):

    pd_1 :  OCR_SHARED_XE_POLICY_DOMAIN was defined, PD8XE
    xe_1 :  OCR_ENABLE_XE_GET_MULTI_WORK was defined,
    ce_0:   OCR_ENABLE_CE_GET_MULTI_WORK was  NOT defined

The post processed result is install_c4_msgstats_pd_1_xe_1_ce_0_4d.csv for MSGSTATS.
The post processed results of Energy Stats is under install_c4_energy_pd_1_xe_1_ce_0_4d/tg/results directory.
