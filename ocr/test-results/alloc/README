This directory contains the test results of Allocator based on three area of changes
    1) For PD, there is PDsingleXE or PD8XE.
    2) For L1, there is ‘no L1’, L1both , L1user , or L1rt; where ‘user’ means
       user app only usage of L1 and ‘rt’ means runtime only usage of L1.
    3) For L2, there is only ‘no L2’, ‘L24k/32k’, ‘L264k/32k’or  indicating that the XE PD,
       not the CE PD, is managing L2.  The ‘4k/32k’ and ‘64k/2048k’ for L2 indicate
       the AllocXeL1MaxSize and AllocXeL2MaxSize, respectively.  The ‘64k/2048k’ implies
       there is NO max size limit checked; but the allocator will return no memory if it is too large.

For each scenario MSGSTATS and Energy Stats are collected.  Testing uses CoMD, RSBench, fib, and fft.
    case 1 – current:  PDsingleXE, L1both, no L2
    case 2 – SR:       PDsingleXE, no L1, no L2
    case 3 – SR:       PD8XE, no L1, no L2
    case 4 – DHE:      PD8XE, L1(both), no L2
    case 5 – DHE:      PD8XE, L1rt, no L2
    case 6 – DHE:      PD8XE, L1user, no L2
    case 7 – DHE:      PD8XE, L1both, L264k/2048k
    case 8 – DHE:      PD8XE, L1both, L24k/32k
    case 9 - DHE:      PD8XE, L1user, L264k/2048k
    case 10- DHE:      PD8XE, L1rt, L264k/2048k

Directory structure:

Under each application directory, there are 16 sub-directories and 8 csv files.
Directory and file names are long, but contain the configuration information. For example,
"c7_install_msgstats_pd_1_user_0_rt_0_l2_1_64K_4d" is the install/tg/logs directory of the
msg stats collected for test case 7 (c7):

    pd_1 :  OCR_SHARED_XE_POLICY_DOMAIN was defined, PD8XE
    user_0: OCR_DISABLE_USER_L1_ALLOC was NOT defined,
    rt_0:   OCR_DISABLE_RUNTIME_L1_ALLOC was also NOT defined, thus L1both
    l2_1:   OCR_ENABLE_XE_L2_ALLOC was defined,
    64K:    AllocXeL1MaxSize set to 64K, L2 set to 2048K

The post processed result is c7_install_msgstats_pd_1_user_0_rt_0_l2_1_64K_4d.csv for MSGSTATS.
The post processed results of Energy Stats is under cx_install_energy_xxxxx/tg/results directory.
