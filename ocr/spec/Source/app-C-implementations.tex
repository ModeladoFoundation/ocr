\chapter{Implementation Notes}
\label{chap:ImplementationNotes}
\label{chap:Appendix C}
This appendix contains details on the ways in which the various OCR
reference implementations differ from the specification. This section
will keep evolving as the implementations become more compliant.
%%%%
\section{General notes}
This section describes the limitations common to all OCR
implementations.
%
\paragraph*{Data block access modes}
The data block access modes are only supported using the {\code
  lockableDB} implementation of data blocks. The {\code regularDB}
implementation ignores the modes. Furthermore, the read-only mode has
not been fully tested.
