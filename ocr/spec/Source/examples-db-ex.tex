The {\tt Exclusive-Write (EW)} mode allows for an easy implementation of mutual exclusion of EDTs execution. When an EDT depend on one or several DBs in {\tt EW} mode, the runtime guarantees it is the only EDT throught the system to currently writing to those DBs.
Hence, the {\tt EW} mode is useful when one wants to guarantee there's no race condition writing to a Data-Block or when ordering among EDTs do not matter for as long as the execution is in mutual exclusion. The following examples shows how two EDTs may share access to a DB in {\tt ITW} mode, while one EDT requires {\tt EW} access. In this situation the programmer cannot assume in which order the EDTs are executed. It might be that EDT1 and EDT2 are executed simultaneously or independently, while EDT3 happens either before, after or in between the others.
