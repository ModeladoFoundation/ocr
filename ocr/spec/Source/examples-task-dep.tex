\subsection{Code example}
This example illustrates several aspect of the OCR API with regards to
the creation of an irregular task graph. Specifically, it illustrates:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Adding dependences between {\bf a)} events and EDTs, {\bf b)}
    data blocks and EDTs, and {\bf c)} the NULL\_GUID and EDTs;}
\item{The use of an EDT's post-slot and how a ``producer'' EDT can
    pass a data block to a ``consumer'' EDT using this post-slot;}
\item{Several methods of satisfying an EDT's pre-slot: {\bf a)}
    through the use of an explicit dependence array at creation time,
    {\bf b)} through the use of another EDT's post-slot and {\bf c)}
    through the use of an explicitly added dependence followed by an
    \texttt{ocrEventSatisfy} call.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Details}

%\paragraph{The graph construction}
The snippet of code shows one possible way to construct the irregular
task-graph shown starting on
Line~\ref{line:task-dep-graph}. \texttt{mainEdt} will create {\bf a)}
\texttt{stage1a} and \texttt{stage1b} as they are the next things that
need to execute but also {\bf b)} \texttt{stage2b} and
\texttt{shutdownEdt} because they are the immediate dominators of those
EDTs. In general, it is easiest to create an EDT in its immediate
dominator because that allows any other EDTs who need to feed it
information (necessarily between its dominator and the EDT in
question) to be able to know the value of the opaque GUID created for
the EDT. \texttt{stage2a}, on the other hand, can be created by
\texttt{stage1a} as no-one else needs to feed information to it.

Most of the ``edges'' in the dependence graph are also created in
\texttt{mainEdt} starting at Line~\ref{line:outEvtToEdtDep}. These
are either between the post-slot (output event) of a source EDT and
an EDT or between a regular event and an EDT. Note also the use of
NULL\_GUID as a source for two dependences starting at
Line~\ref{line:nullGuidToEdt}. A NULL\_GUID as a source for a
dependence immediately satisfies the destination slot; in this case,
it satisfies the unique dependence of \texttt{stage1a} and
\texttt{stage1b} and makes them runable. These two dependences do not
exist in the graph shown starting at Line~\ref{line:task-dep-graph}
but are crucial to avoid a potential race in the program: the output
events of EDTs are similar to ONCE events in the sense that they will
disappear once they are satisfied and therefore, any dependence on
them must be properly setup prior to their potential satisfaction. In
other words, the \texttt{ocrAddDependence} calls starting at
Line~\ref{line:outEvtToEdtDep} must \emph{happen-before} the
satisfaction of \texttt{stage1aOut} and \texttt{stage1bOut}.
%%%%
%\paragraph{Satisfying pre-slots}
This example shows three methods of satisfying an EDT's pre-slots:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Through the use of an explicit dependence array known at EDT
    creation time as shown on Line~\ref{line:expDep};}
\item{Through an output event as shown on
    Line~\ref{line:EdtGuidReturn}. The GUID passed as a return value
    of the EDT function will be passed to the EDT's output event (in
    this case \texttt{stage1aOut}). If the GUID is a data block's
    GUID, the output event will be satisfied with that data block. If
    it is an event's GUID, the two events will become linked;}
\item{Through an explicit satisfaction as shown on
    Line~\ref{line:expSatisfy}).}
\end{itemize}
