% Ideas for putting examples here:
%   - We should figure out what APIs or model characteristics we want
%   to demonstrate in each example (and put it here so we know)
%   - Each code snippet should show that feature and allow for the
%   entire example to be constructed from that snippet and any
%   previous snippets (i.e.: we don't have to put the whole program
%   every time but it should be ``obvious'' how to build it)

\chapter{OCR  Examples}
\label{chap:OCR Examples}
\label{chap:Appendix A}


This chapter demonstrates the use of OCR through a series of
examples. The examples are ordered from the most basic to the most
complicated and frequently make use of previous examples. They are
meant to guide the reader in understanding the fundamental concepts of
the OCR programming model and API.

\section{OCR's ``Hello World!''}
% In this example:
%   - APIs: ocrMain, ocrShutdown, PRINTF, getArgc, getArgv
%   - Functionality: program entry point, argument passing, shutdown
%   - Concepts: None
