\section{OCR core types, macros, and error codes}
\index{OCR types, macros, and error codes}
\label{sec:OCRtypesmacros}

The OCR Application Programming Interface (API) is defined in terms of a
C language binding. The functions comprising the OCR API make use of a number of
basic data types defined in the include file \code{ocr.h}.
%%
\paragraph*{Base low-level types}
The lowest level data types are defined in terms of the following C typedef
statements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_u64}{\code{typedef uint64\_t u64}} 64-bit unsigned integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_u32}{\code{typedef uint32\_t u32}} 32-bit unsigned integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_u16}{\code{typedef uint16\_t u16}} 16-bit unsigned integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_u8}{\code{typedef uint8\_t u8}} 8-bit unsigned integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_s64}{\code{typedef int64\_t s64}} 64-bit signed integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_s32}{\code{typedef int32\_t s32}} 32-bit signed integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_s8}{\code{typedef int8\_t s8}} 8-bit signed integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_bool}{\code{typedef u8 bool}} 8-bit boolean.
\end{itemize}
%%
\paragraph*{OCR opaque types}
In addition to these low level types, OCR defines a number of opaque data types
to manage OCR objects and to interact with the OCR environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrGuid_t}{\code{ocrGuid\_t}}: Opaque handle used to
reference all OCR objects;
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrEdtDep_t}{\code{ocrEdtDep\_t}}: Type of dependences as
passed into the EDTs; it contains both the GUID and the pointer to any data block
passed as a dependence.
% REC: Move to extension; this is part of the ``library mode''
%  Is this exposed as part of the API?  Or does this belong in one of the appendices?
%\item \code{ocrConfig\_t Struct}:  Reference
%Data-structure containing the configuration parameters for the runtime.
\end{itemize}
%%
\paragraph*{Other constants}
The C API for OCR makes use of a set of basic macros defined
inside \code{ocr.h}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{\#define true 1};
\item \code{\#define TRUE 1};
\item \code{\#define false 0};
\item \code{\#define FALSE 0};
\item \code{\#define NULL\_GUID}: A NULL ocrGuid\_t;
\item \code{\#define UNINITIALIZED\_GUID}: An Unitialized GUID (ie: never set);
\item \code{\#define ERROR\_GUID}: An invalid GUID.
\end{itemize}
%%
\paragraph*{OCR error codes}
The OCR error codes are derived from standard error codes. They are defined
internally to limit OCR's dependence on standard libraries. Most functions in the
OCR API will return a status code where 0 signifies successful completion. A non-zero
return code will be one of the following error codes. These codes are found
in the \code{ocr-errors.h} include file and described in Table~\ref{tab:errorcodes}.

%% The OCR Main EDT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{OCR entry point: \code{mainEdt}}
\label{sec:mainEDT}

An OCR program's single point of entry is the user-defined main EDT (\code{mainEdt()}).
This EDT has a function prototype that is identical to any other EDT; its parameters
and dependences are however special: the main EDT has no parameters and has a single
input data block that encodes the araguments passed to the program from the
command line. The arguments can be accessed using \hyperlink{func_getArgc}{\code{getArgc()}}
and \hyperlink{func_getArgv}{\code{getArgv()}}.

\begin{boxedcode}
\plc{ocrGuid\_t mainEdt(u32 paramc, u64* paramv, u32 depc, ocrEdtDep\_t depv[])}
\end{boxedcode}

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{paramc} & Parameters count will always be 0.\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{paramv} & Parameter version will always be NULL.\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{depc} & Dependence count will always be 1.\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{depv} & Dependence vector will have exactly 1 entry
containing a data block that encodes the command line arguments.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
\code{mainEdt} returns a \hyperlink{type_ocrGuid_t}{\code{ocrGuid\_t}} which is
ignored by the runtime. The returned value of an OCR program is set using
\hyperlink{func_ocrShutdown}{\code{ocrShutdown()}} or \hyperlink{func_ocrAbort}{
  \code{ocrAbort()}}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Supporting Functions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Supporting functions}
\label{sec:supportFuncs}

OCR provides a set of basic capabilities to support a program execution environment,
handled through the following functions.

\subsection*{Functions}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item
  void \hyperlink{func_ocrShutdown}{\code{ocrShutdown}}(void)
    \begin{DoxyCompactList}
      \small\item \emph{Called by an EDT to indicate the normal end of an OCR program.}
    \end{DoxyCompactList}
\item
  void \hyperlink{func_ocrAbort}{\code{ocrAbort}}(\hyperlink{type_u8}{u8} errorCode)
    \begin{DoxyCompactList}
      \small\item \emph{Called by an EDT to indicate an abnormal end of an OCR program.}
    \end{DoxyCompactList}
\item
  \hyperlink{type_u64}{u64} \hyperlink{func_getArgc}{\code{getArgc}}(void $\ast$dbPtr)
    \begin{DoxyCompactList}
      \small\item \emph{Retrieves the traditional `argc' value from
        \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt()}}'s input data block.}
    \end{DoxyCompactList}
\item
  char $\ast$ \hyperlink{func_getArgv}{\code{getArgv}}(void $\ast$dbPtr,
  \hyperlink{type_u64}{u64} count)
    \begin{DoxyCompactList}
      \small\item \emph{Retrieves the `count' argument from
        \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt()}}'s input data block.}
    \end{DoxyCompactList}
\item
  \hyperlink{type_u32}{u32} \hyperlink{func_PRINTF}{PRINTF}(const char $\ast$format, ...)
    \begin{DoxyCompactList}
      \small\item \emph{\code{printf()} equivalent for OCR.}
    \end{DoxyCompactList}
\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
%
% ocrShutdown
%
\hypertarget{func_ocrShutdown}{
  \index{Supporting functions@{Supporting function}!ocr\-Shutdown@{ocr\-Shutdown}}
  \subsection[{ocr\-Shutdown}]{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}void ocr\-Shutdown(
)}}
\label{func_ocrShutdown}

The user is responsible for indicating the end of an OCR program using an explicit
shutdown call (either this function or \hyperlink{func_ocrAbort}{\code{ocrAbort()}}).
Any EDTs which have not reached the \emph{runnable} state will never be executed.
EDTs in the \emph{runnable} or \emph{ready} state may or may not execute.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Program behavior after this call is undefined. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The statements in the calling EDT \emph{after} this function
    call may or may not be executed;
  \item EDTs in the \emph{runnable} or \emph{ready} state may or may not
    execute.
\end{itemize}

Although most programs will choose to call \code{ocrShutdown()} in the ``last'' EDT,
OCR specifically allows another EDT to call \code{ocrShutdown()} to support, for
example, a computation of the type ``find-first-of''; in such a computation, the
program can successfully complete even if all EDTs have not executed.
\end{DoxyNote}
%
% ocrAbort
%
\hypertarget{func_ocrAbort}{
  \index{Supporting functions@{Supporting functions}!ocr\-Abort@{ocr\-Abort}}
  \subsection[{ocr\-Abort}]{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}void ocr\-Abort(
\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{{\bf u8}}]{error\-Code}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_ocrAbort}

This function is very similar to \hyperlink{func_ocrShutdown}{\code{ocrShutdown()}}
except that it allows for the return of a non-zero value.

The abort error code is passed back to the runtime and its handling is
implementation dependent

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{errorCode} & User defined error code returned to the runtime.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\descr
See notes in Section~\ref{func_ocrShutdown}.
%
% getArgc
%
\hypertarget{func_getArgc}{
  \index{Supporting functions@{Supporting function}!get\-Argc@{get\-Argc}}
  \subsection[{get\-Argc}]{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}{\bf u64} get\-Argc(
\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{void $\ast$}]{db\-Ptr}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_getArgc}

Returns the number of arguments (traditionally called `argc') passed to the OCR program.
The value is extracted from the unique data block passed to \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt}}.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{dbPtr} & Pointer to the start of the argument data block\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
The number of arguments passed to the OCR program on the command line

\descr
When starting, the first EDT (called \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt}}) is
passed a single input data block which encodes the arguments passed to the main
program:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The first 8 bytes encode `argc';
\item The following `argc' 8-byte values encode the offset
  from the start of the data block to the arguments;
\item The arguments are then appended as NULL terminated
  character arrays.
\end{DoxyItemize}
%
% getArgv
%
\hypertarget{func_getArgv}{
  \index{Supporting functions@{Supporting function}!get\-Argv@{get\-Argv}}
  \subsection[{get\-Argv}]{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}{\bf char $\ast$} get\-Argv(
\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{void $\ast$}]{db\-Ptr}
\item[{{\bf u64}}]{count}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_getArgv}

Returns the `count' argument passed to the OCR program.
The value is extracted from the unique data block passed to \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt}}.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{dbPtr} & Pointer to the start of the argument data block\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{count} & Index of the argument to extract\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
A NULL terminated string corresponding to \code{argv[count]}.

\descr
See Section~\ref{func_getArgc} for details.
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Attempting to extract an argument with \code{count} greater or equal to the value
returned by \hyperlink{func_getArgc}{\code{getArgc}} will result in undefined
behavior.
\end{DoxyNote}
%
% PRINTF
%
\hypertarget{func_PRINTF}{
  \index{Supporting functions@{Supporting function}!PRINTF@{PRINTF}}
  \subsection[{PRINTF}]{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}{\bf u32} PRINTF(
\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{const char $\ast$}]{fmt}
\item[{}]{...}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_PRINTF}

A platform independent limited \code{printf} functionality.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{fmt} & NULL terminated C format string containing the
format of the output string\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{...} & A varaible length list of arguments in agreement with
\code{fmt}\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
This function returns the number of bytes written out as a
\hyperlink{type_u32}{\code{u32}}.

\descr
OCR must support a wide variety of platforms including simulators that emulate
real systems. Often, core functionality provided by standard C libraries are not
available on all platforms, and, as a result, an OCR program cannot depend on
these functions. There was one case, however, where it was felt support was
critical: basic printf. This function supports basic printing functionality
and supports the following format specifiers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Strings using \code{\%s};
\item 32-bit integers using \code{\%d}, \code{\%u}, \code{\%x} and \code{\%X};
\item 64-bit integers using \code{\%ld}, \code{\%lu}, \code{\%lx}, \code{\%lX},
  and versions with two `l';
\item 64-bit pointers using \code{\%p};
\item Floating point numbers using \code{\%f}, \code{\%e} and \code{\%E};
\item The `\#' flag is supported for \code{\%x}, \code{\%lx} and \code{\%llx};
\item Precision modifiers are also supported for \code{\%f}, \code{\%e} and \code{\%E}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
A conformant implementation may limit the number of characters in the
output string.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Data Block Management
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Data block management}
\index{Data block management APIs}
\label{sec:OCRdataBlockManagement}

Data blocks are the only form of non-\/ephemeral storage and are therefore
the only way to ``share'' data between E\-D\-Ts. Conceptually, data blocks
are contiguous chunks of memory that have a start address and a size.
They also have the following characteristics\-:
\begin{itemize}
\item all memory within the data block is accessible from the start-\/address
  using an offset (ie\-: addresses \mbox{[}start-\/address; start-\/address+size\mbox{[}
  uniquely and totally address the entire data-\/block);
\item a data block is non-\/overlapping with other distinct data blocks
\item the pointer to the start of a data block is only valid between the start
of the E\-D\-T (or the data block creation) and the corresponding \code{ocrDbRelease}
(or the end of the E\-D\-T).
\end{itemize}

The following macros and enums are used with OCR data blocks.
\begin{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrInDbAllocator_t}{\code{enum ocrInDbAllocator\_t}} containing:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \code{NO\_ALLOC} The data block is not used as a heap
  \end{itemize}
\item \code{enum ocrDbAccessMode\_t} containing the four access modes. The
meaning of the access modes is given in Section~\ref{sec:datablocks}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_RW}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_EW}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_RO}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_CONST}
  \end{itemize}
\item \code{DB\_DEFAULT\_MODE} which is an alias of \code{DB\_MODE\_RW}
\item \code{DB\_PROP\_NONE} which specifies no special properties on the data block
\item \code{DB\_PROP\_NO\_ACQUIRE} which specifies that the data block should
  not be acquired on creation
% REC: Removed SINGLE_ASSIGNMENT; only used in distributed and not part of the
% described modes/functionality
\end{itemize}

%% This is a repeat of sec:datablocks. Keeping for now commented.

%% These are the modes with which an EDT can access a data block.
%% OCR currently supports four modes:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item \code{DB\_MODE\_RW} Read-Write (default mode): The EDT is stating that it
%% may read from and write-to the data block. The user is responsible for
%% synchronizing between EDTs that could potentially write to the same data block
%% concurrently.
%% \item \code{DB\_MODE\_EW} Exclusive-Write (EW): The EDT requires that it be
%% the only one writing to the data block. The runtime will not schedule any other
%% EDT that accesses the same data block in RW or EW mode concurrently.
%% This can limit parallelism.
%% \item \code{DB\_MODE\_RO} Read-Only: The EDT is stating that it will only read
%% from the data block. The runtime will not enforce this restriction but the
%% visibility of any writes done by the EDT is undefined. The runtime also does
%% not guarantee that concurrent writes to the data block from other EDTs
%% will not be visible. In other words, another concurrent EDT in EW or RW mode may
%% concurrently access the data block and modify it while this EDT is accessing it in
%% RO mode.
%% \item \code{DB\_MODE\_CONST} Constant: Similarly to the RO mode, the EDT is
%% again stating that it will not write to the data block. In this mode, however,
%% the runtime guarantees that the data block seen by the EDT will not be modified
%% by other concurrent EDTs. Similarly to the RO mode, the visibility of any writes
%% by this EDT (in violation of the ``contract'') is undefined.
%% \end{itemize}

\label{func_ocrDbCreate}

Requests the creation of a data block of the specified size. After
a successful call, the runtime will return the GUID for the newly
created data block and a pointer to it (if requested).

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt out}  & \code{db} & On successful creation, contains the GUID
of the data block. If the call fails, the returned value is undefined.\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt out}  & \code{addr} & On successful creation and if the

  this EDT (NULL will be returned in \code{addr}). Note that a conforming
  implementation may delay the creation of the data block until it is
  acquired by another EDT.
\end{DoxyItemize}\\
\hline

should be NULL\_GUID \\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in}  & \code{allocator} & A data block can be used as the
backing memory for malloc/free-like operations. This parameter
specifies the allocator to use for these operations inside this

should not write directly to the data block as this may overwrite the
meta data used by the allocator. The 'NO\_ALLOC' allocator is used to
indicate that the data block is not used by any allocator and is
therefore usable as POD. Supported values for this parameter are given
by \hyperlink{type_ocrInDbAllocator_t}{ocrInDbAllocator\_t}.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
A status code:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0: Successful
\item OCR\_ENOMEM: The runtime could not provide a data-block of size
  'len' due to insufficient memory
\item OCR\_EINVAL: The arguments passed (flags, allocator, etc.) were
  not valid
\item OCR\_EBUSY: A resource required for this call was busy. A retry
  is possible
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
This function is used to create the basic unit of data in OCR: the
data block. Unless DB\_PROP\_NO\_ACQUIRE is specified in \code{flags}, this
function also acquires the newly created data block and returns a
pointer to the start of the data block in \code{addr}.

The created data block:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Will always be 8-byte aligned
\item Will not necessarily be zeroed out; the value of the created
  data block is undefined;
\item Will have a GUID that is unique from this call until the user
  calls \code{ocrDbDestroy()} on this data block.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using the DB\_PROP\_NO\_ACQUIRE flag is recommended to allow the
  runtime to make placement decisions for newly created
  data blocks. Not specifying this flag may result in a sub-optimal
  memory placement for the created data block.
\item When DB\_PROP\_NO\_ACQUIRE is specified, a conformant
  implementation may choose not to create the data-block immediately
  and instead create it lazily before the using EDT runs.
\item Like all GUIDs, the uniqueness of a data block's GUID is not
  necessarily unique throughout the entire program. A data block's
  GUID is guaranteed unique only as long as the data block exists
  (between \code{ocrDbCreate()} and \code{ocrDbDestroy()}).

\label{func_ocrDbDestroy}

Request for the destruction of a data block. All created data blocks should be
destroyed when no longer needed to reclaim the space they utilize.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & \code{db} & GUID of the data block to destroy \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
A status code:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0: successful
\item OCR\_EPERM: The data block was already destroyed
\item OCR\_EINVAL: The GUID passed as argument does not refer to
  a valid data block
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
OCR does not perform automatic garbage collection; all created data blocks therefore
need to be explicitly destroyed by the user. This function will request the
destruction of a data block but said destruction will be delayed until all
EDTs that have acquired the data block have released it (either explicitly with
\hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease()}} or by transitioning to the
\emph{released} state).

This function does not need to be called by an EDT that has acquired the data block.
If the EDT did acquire the data block, however, this function will implicitly
release it (equivalent to calling \hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease()}}.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Not all instances of the errors indicated by the error codes can be caught. In
other words, attempting the destroy a data block multiple times may result in the
return of an error code but may also result in undefined behavior.

\begin{DoxyParamCaption}

)}}
\label{func_ocrDbRelease}

An EDT acquires a data block either on creation with \hyperlink{func_ocrDbCreate}{\code{ocrDbCreate()}}
or implicitly when it transitions to the \emph{ready} state. All acquired data blocks
will be implicitly released by the runtime when the EDT transitions to the
\emph{released} state but they can be released earlier using this function.
Releasing a data block indicates that the EDT no longer has use for it and also
enables other EDTs to ``see'' the eventual changes to the data block (release consistency).

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & \code{db} & GUID of the data block to release\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
A status code:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0: successful
\item OCR\_EINVAL: The GUID passed as argument does not refer to a
  valid data block
\item OCR\_EACCESS: The calling EDT has not acquired the data block
  and therefore cannot release it
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
This function is critical in ensuring proper memory ordering in OCR. A data block
can be ``shared'' with another EDT B by satisfying an event that B depends on. B
is only guaranteed to see the changes made to the data block by this EDT if this
EDT releases the data block before satisfying the event B depends on with this
data block.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Once the EDT releases a data block, it can no longer read or write to it (the
pointer it had to it should be considered invalid). Violating this rule will
result in undefined behavior. A consequence of this is that a data block can
only be released at most once by an EDT.

\section{Event Management}
\index{Event management APIs}
\label{sec:OCReventManagement}

Events are used to coordinate the execution of tasks and to
help establish dependences in the directed acyclic graph representing the
execution of an OCR program.

The following macros and enums are used with OCR events:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrEventTypes_t}{\code{enum ocrEventTypes\_t}} containing the types of supported events. The
meaning of these event types is given in Section~\ref{sec:Event}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_ONCE\_T}
    \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_IDEM\_T}
    \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_STICKY\_T}
    \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_LATCH\_T}
  \end{itemize}
%% \code{OCR\_EVENT\_ONCE\_T} - \emph{Once} Event: A ONCE event simply passes along a satisfaction on its
%% unique pre-slot to its post-slot. Once all OCR objects linked to its post-slot have been satisfied,
%% the ONCE event is automatically destroyed.
%% \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_IDEM\_T} - \emph{Idempotent} Event: An IDEM event also passes along a satisfaction on its
%% unique pre-slot to its post-slot. The IDEM event persists until ocrEventDestroy() is explicitly called on it.
%% It can only be satisfied once and subsequent satisfactions are ignored.
%% \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_STICKY\_T} - \emph{Sticky} Event: A STICKY event is identical to an IDEM event except that
%% multiple satisfactions result in an error.
%% \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_LATCH\_T} - \emph{Latch} Event: A LATCH event has two pre-slots: a INCR and a DECR.
%% Each slot is associated with an internal monotonically increasing counter that starts at 0.
%% On each satisfaction of one of the pre-slots, the counter for that slot is incremented by 1.
%% When both counters are equal (and non-zero), the post-slot of the latch event is triggered.
%% Any data block passed along its pre-slots is ignored. A LATCH event is similarly persistent
%% as a ONCE event and is automatically destroyed when its post-slot is triggered.
\item \code{enum ocrLatchEventSlots\_t} containing constants to identify the two
pre-slots of the latch event type:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_LATCH\_DECR\_SLOT} identifying the decrement slot of
      the latch event
    \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_LATCH\_INCR\_SLOT} identifying the increment slot of
      the latch event
  \end{itemize}

\descr
\emph{Once} and \emph{latch} events are automatically destroyed by the runtime
when they trigger and propagate their satisfaction to the objects connected to
their post-slots; those events should not be destroyed using this function. Other
events, however, need to be destroyed when they are no longer needed.

\label{func_ocrEventSatisfySlot}

Satisfy the specified pre-slot of an event thereby potentially causing waiting
EDTs to become \emph{runnable}. This function is the primary method of
synchronization in OCR.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & \code{eventGuid} & GUID of the event to satisfy\\

\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
A status code
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 0\-: successful
\item OCR\_ENOMEM: The runtime could not satisfy the event due to insufficent
  memory
\item OCR\_EINVAL: \code{eventGuid} or \code{dataGuid} do not refer
  to valid event or data block GUIDs respectively
\item OCR\_EPERM: The event has already been satisfied and does not support
  multiple satisfactions or a data block was passed to an event which does
  not take arguments
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
Satisfying the pre-slot of an event will potentially trigger the satisfaction of
its post-\/slot depending on its trigger rule:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \emph{Once}, \emph{idempotentent} and \emph{sticky} events will
  satisfy their post-slot upon satisfaction of their pre-slot
\item \emph{Latch} events will trigger if and only if the number of
  satisfactions on both their pre-slots is equal. See Section~\ref{sec:Event} for
  more detail.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The \code{dataGuid} argument is used to associate a data block with the event.
\emph{Once}, \emph{idempotent} and \emph{sticky} events will pass this data block
down their post slot. An EDT connected to the post-slot of the event (or the post-slot
of a chain of events connected to this event) will acquire the data block
associated with this event when it transitions to the \emph{ready} state.
A data block passed to a \emph{latch} event is ignored.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
OCR's memory model (see Section~\ref{sec:MemoryModel}) imposes that, to guarantee
the visibility of the writes to a data block passed to an event (and therefore
potentially immediately acquired by an EDT), data blocks need to be
\emph{released} with \hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease}} prior to
the satisfaction of the event. Failure to follow this rule will result in
undefined behavior. Note that data blocks written to by a preceding EDT will already
have been released when that EDT finished and moved to the \emph{release} stage.

Event Driven Tasks -- E\-D\-Ts -- act as the task abstraction of O\-C\-R, and all
program computations are expressed using E\-D\-Ts.


\begin{itemize}
\item \#define EDT\_PROP\_NONE
\item \#define EDT\_PROP\_FINISH

\descr
The E\-D\-T is created based on the function provided during the creation of its template. It is required that the number of parameters
(paramc) and number of dependences (depc) are resolved at this time, if E\-D\-T\-\_\-\-P\-A\-R\-A\-M\-\_\-\-U\-N\-K was specified for
either argument at the time of creation of its corresponding template. The properties field indicates what type of E\-D\-T gets created.
Currently, O\-C\-R supports (i) the default type of E\-D\-T where the lifetime of the created E\-D\-T has no relationship with that of
other E\-D\-Ts created by it, and (ii) a finish E\-D\-T, where the lifetime of the created E\-D\-T is guaranteed to exceed that of all
E\-D\-Ts transitively created by it.

Destroy an E\-D\-T.

E\-D\-Ts are automatically destroyed after they execute. This call is provided if an E\-D\-T is created and the programmer later realizes that it will never become runnable.

\descr
This function can be called if no further E\-D\-Ts will be created based on this template, and the
memory allocated for this template can be recovered by the runtime. The template can be destroyed
even if any of the E\-D\-Ts created from it aren't ready to run.

At the core of OCR is the concept of a directed acyclic graph that represents the evolving
state of an OCR program.   OCR objects become runnable once their dependences are met.
These dependences can be set explicitly when creating the OCR object or dynamically using the functions
from this section of the API.

\item E\-N\-O\-P\-E\-R\-M\-: The source and destination G\-U\-I\-Ds cannot be linked with a dependence
\end{DoxyItemize}


\descr
The following dependences can be added\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Event to Event\-: The sink event's pre-\/slot will become satisfied upon satisfaction of the source event's post-\/slot. Any data block associated with the source event's post-\/slot will be associated with the sink event's pres-\/slot.
\item Event to E\-D\-T \-: Upon satisfaction of the source event's post-\/slot, the pre-\/slot of the E\-D\-T will be satisfied. When the E\-D\-T runs, the data block associated with the post-\/slot of the event will be passed in through the \code{depv} array. This represents a control or a control+data dependence.
\item D\-B to Event \-: ocr\-Add\-Dependence(db, evt, slot) is equivalent to ocr\-Satisfy\-Slot(evt, db, slot)
\item D\-B to E\-D\-T \-: This represents a pure data dependence. Adding a dependence between a data block and an E\-D\-T immediately satisfies the pre-\/slot of the E\-D\-T. When the E\-D\-T runs, the data block will be passed in through the \code{depv} array.
