\section{OCR core types and macros}
\index{OCR types and macros}
\label{sec:OCRtypesmacros}

The OCR Application Programming Interface (API) is defined in terms of a
C language binding. The functions comprising the OCR API make use of a number of
basic data types defined in the include file \code{ocr.h}.
%%
\paragraph*{Base low-level types}
The lowest level data types are defined in terms of the following C typedef
statements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_u64}{\code{typedef uint64\_t u64}} 64-bit unsigned integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_u32}{\code{typedef uint32\_t u32}} 32-bit unsigned integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_u16}{\code{typedef uint16\_t u16}} 16-bit unsigned integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_u8}{\code{typedef uint8\_t u8}} 8-bit unsigned integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_s64}{\code{typedef int64\_t s64}} 64-bit signed integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_s32}{\code{typedef int32\_t s32}} 32-bit signed integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_s8}{\code{typedef int8\_t s8}} 8-bit signed integer;
\item \hypertarget{type_bool}{\code{typedef u8 bool}} 8-bit boolean.
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrEdtDep_t}{\code{ocrEdtDep\_t}}: Type of
  dependences as passed into the EDTs. It contains at least two fields
  that can be used by the programmer: \code{guid} which contains the
  GUID of the data block passed in and \code{ptr} which contains a
  pointer to the aforementioned data block.
\end{itemize}
%%
\paragraph*{OCR opaque types}
In addition to these low level types, OCR defines a number of opaque data types
to manage OCR objects and to interact with the OCR environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrGuid_t}{\code{ocrGuid\_t}}: Opaque handle used to
reference all OCR objects. An \code{ocrGuid\_t} is truly opaque and
the user cannot assume that it is of a given size;
\end{itemize}
%%
\paragraph*{OCR version utilities}
OCR provides macros to determine the API implemented and the
extensions that are enabled:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{OCR\_VERSION}: A string representing the API version
  implemented.
\item \code{OCR\_VERSION\_GET\_MAJOR(vers)}: Extract the unsigned
  integer representing the major revision of the OCR API. This is the
  first digit of the version string.
\item \code{OCR\_VERSION\_GET\_MINOR(vers)}: Extract the unsigned
  integer representing the minor revision of the OCR API. This is the
  middle digit of the version string.
\item \code{OCR\_VERSION\_GET\_PATCH(vers)}: Extract the unsigned
  integer representing the patch number of the OCR API. This is the
  last digit of the version string.
\item \code{OCR\_VERSION\_EXTENSION\_BITMAP}: A bitmap representing
  the extensions enabled. The file ``ocr-version.h'' defines the
  possible extensions that are encoded in this bitmap.
\end{itemize}
%%
\paragraph*{Other constants}
The C API for OCR makes use of a set of basic macros defined
inside \code{ocr.h}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{\#define true 1};
\item \code{\#define TRUE 1};
\item \code{\#define false 0};
\item \code{\#define FALSE 0};
\item \code{\#define NULL\_HINT}: A NULL pointer to ocrHint\_t.
\item \code{\#define NULL\_GUID}: A reserved GUID value, used to indicate the absence of an OCR object.
This value is roughly analogous to a null pointer; however, it cannot be assumed to be equal to zero.
\item \code{\#define UNINITIALIZED\_GUID}: A reserved GUID value, used as a placeholder to indicate
that a value is uninitialized.
\item \code{\#define ERROR\_GUID}: A reserved GUID value, used to indicate that an error has occurred.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%
\section{OCR API conventions}
\index{OCR API conventions}
In OCR, most APIs are allowed to be \emph{deferred} or \emph{executed asynchronously} by the runtime implementation
but all implementations guarantee that the effects of the execution of the API calls by the runtime will be
identical to the non-deferred and sequential execution of the calls as specified by the user. Note that for
APIs that return a value to the user (for example a GUID, a pointer, etc.), all runtime implementations guarantee
that the values returned are valid; in other words, a portion of the call may be deferred but the user can
rely on the returned values.
%%%%
\subsection{Conventions}
In this chapter, the OCR APIs are discussed in detail. API calls not related to support functions
(Section~\ref{sec:supportFuncs}) or GUID management (Section~\ref{sec:OCRGuidManagement}) all
follow certain conventions described below
%
\paragraph*{API names}
All API names start with ``ocr'' followed by the type of object the call refers to
\footnote{\hyperlink{func_ocrAddDependence}{\code{ocrAddDependence()}} being the lone exception to this naming
convention.} such as ``Edt'', ``Db'' or ``Event'' followed by the action on that event.
%
\paragraph*{Arguments}
Arguments that are used as ``out'' or ``in/out'' arguments, if any, are listed first in the calls. ``Out'' or
``in/out'' arguments are always pointers. ``In'' arguments are either values or pointers to constants.
%
\paragraph*{Error codes}
All API calls return an error code with the convention that 0 means the call was successful. Error codes are discussed
in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:errorCodes}.
%%%%
\subsection{OCR error codes}
\label{sec:errorCodes}
The OCR error codes are derived from standard error codes. They are defined
internally to limit OCR's dependence on standard libraries. OCR uses the convention that a function's
return value is its error code where a code of zero signifies successful completion. It is, however,
important to note that given the potential deferred and asynchronous nature of OCR API calls, not all errors
will be reported at the site of the call. This distinction is discussed later in this section.
The error codes returned are found
in the \code{ocr-errors.h} include file and described in
Table~\ref{tab:errorcodes}.

\plc{OCR\_EACQ} & Data block is already acquired\\
\plc{OCR\_EPEND} & Operation is pending\\
\plc{OCR\_ECANCELED} & Operation canceled\\
\end{supertabular}
%
\paragraph*{Immediate versus deferred error}
Since the OCR APIs can be deferred or executed asynchronously by the underlying
implementation, not all error codes can be reported immediately at the API call-site. In the
API description in the following sections, the error codes returned are separated into
two categories: {\bf a)} the \emph{immediate} error codes that are guaranteed to be returned at the call-site and
{\bf b)} the \emph{deferred} error codes that \emph{may} be returned either at the call-site but also
later (see the following paragraph for more detail).

Immediate errors are typically errors that result from incorrect arguments. Deferred errors are
either returned at the call-site or reported later, depending on the implementation. In other words,
if the return code of an API call is zero, this means that either the function completed without any
errors or that one of the deferred errors may occur later.
%
\paragraph*{Reporting of deferred errors}
Currently, if an error occurs in a deferred manner, implementations are allowed to crash but will
report the API call that caused the crash (deferred error) by reporting to the user at least the following
information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{File and line-number of the API call that caused the error;}
  \item{Error code;}
  \item{GUIDs of both the EDT in which the error occurred and the target object for the
        error (typically the first argument of the API call).
  }
\end{itemize}
Future revisions of this specification will provide a handler mechanism which would allow a user
to determine if an error is fatal or if it can be recovered from.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The OCR Main EDT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hypertarget{func_mainEdt}{
\section{OCR entry point: \code{mainEdt}}}
\label{sec:mainEDT}

An OCR program's single point of entry is the user-defined main EDT (\code{mainEdt()}).
This EDT has a function prototype that is identical to any other EDT; its parameters
and dependences are however special: the main EDT has no parameters and has a single
input data block that encodes the arguments passed to the program from the
command line. The arguments can be accessed using \hyperlink{func_ocrGetArgc}{\code{ocrGetArgc()}}
and \hyperlink{func_ocrGetArgv}{\code{ocrGetArgv()}}.

\begin{boxedcode}
\plc{ocrGuid\_t mainEdt(u32 paramc, u64* paramv, u32 depc, ocrEdtDep\_t depv[])}
\end{boxedcode}

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{paramc} & Parameters count will always be 0.\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{paramv} & Parameter version will always be NULL.\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{depc} & Dependence count will always be 1.\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{depv} & Dependence vector will have exactly 1 entry
containing a data block that encodes the command line arguments.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
\code{mainEdt} returns a \hyperlink{type_ocrGuid_t}{\code{ocrGuid\_t}} which is
ignored by the runtime. The returned value of an OCR program is set using
\hyperlink{func_ocrShutdown}{\code{ocrShutdown()}} or \hyperlink{func_ocrAbort}{
  \code{ocrAbort()}}.

%% Supporting Functions

\section{Supporting functions}
\label{sec:supportFuncs}

OCR provides a set of basic capabilities to support a program execution environment,
handled through the following functions.

\subsection*{Functions}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item
  void \hyperlink{func_ocrShutdown}{\code{ocrShutdown}}(void)
    \begin{DoxyCompactList}

    \end{DoxyCompactList}
\item

        \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt()}}'s input data block.}
    \end{DoxyCompactList}

    \begin{DoxyCompactList}
      \small\item \emph{\code{printf()} equivalent for OCR.}

\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
%
% ocrShutdown
%
\hypertarget{func_ocrShutdown}{
  \index{Supporting functions@{Supporting function}!ocr\-Shutdown@{ocr\-Shutdown}}
  \subsection[{ocr\-Shutdown}]{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}void ocr\-Shutdown(
)}}
\label{func_ocrShutdown}

The user is responsible for indicating the end of an OCR program using an explicit
shutdown call (either this function or \hyperlink{func_ocrAbort}{\code{ocrAbort()}}).
Any EDTs which have not reached the \emph{runnable} state will never be executed.
EDTs in the \emph{runnable} or \emph{ready} state may or may not
execute. Calling \code{ocrShutdown()} will properly terminate the
runtime; all memory and computing resources will be
released. Furthermore, a zero exit code will be returned to the
caller of the OCR program indicating a normal termination.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Program behavior after this call is undefined. Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The statements in the calling EDT \emph{after} this function
    call may or may not be executed;
  \item EDTs in the \emph{runnable} or \emph{ready} state may or may not
    execute.
\end{itemize}

Although most programs will choose to call \code{ocrShutdown()} in the ``last'' EDT,
OCR specifically allows another EDT to call \code{ocrShutdown()} to support, for
example, a computation of the type ``find-first-of''; in such a computation, the
program can successfully complete even if all EDTs have not executed.
\end{DoxyNote}
%
% ocrAbort

\hypertarget{func_ocrAbort}{

\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{{\bf u8}}]{error\-Code}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_ocrAbort}

This function is very similar to \hyperlink{func_ocrShutdown}{\code{ocrShutdown()}}
except that it allows for the return of a non-zero value. This
function also does not guarantee that the runtime will properly shut
itself down. This call should only be used to indicate an abnormal termination.

The abort error code is passed back to the runtime and its handling is
implementation dependent

\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{void $\ast$}]{db\-Ptr}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_ocrGetArgc}

Returns the number of arguments (traditionally called `argc') passed to the OCR program.
The value is extracted from the unique data block passed to \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt}}.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{dbPtr} & Pointer to the start of the argument data block\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
The number of arguments passed to the OCR program on the command line

\descr
When starting, the first EDT (called \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt}}) is
passed a single input data block which encodes the arguments passed to the main
program:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The first 8 bytes encode `argc';
\item The following `argc' 8-byte values encode the offset
  from the start of the data block to the arguments;
\item The arguments are then appended as NULL terminated
  character arrays.

\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{void $\ast$}]{db\-Ptr}
\item[{{\bf u64}}]{index}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_ocrGetArgv}

Returns the $index^{th}$ argument passed to the OCR program.
The value is extracted from the unique data block passed to \hyperlink{func_mainEdt}{\code{mainEdt}}.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{dbPtr} & Pointer to the start of the argument data block\\
\hline

\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
A NULL terminated string corresponding to \code{argv[index]}.

\descr
See Section~\ref{func_ocrGetArgc} for details.
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Attempting to extract an argument with \code{index} greater or equal to the value
returned by \hyperlink{func_ocrGetArgc}{\code{ocrGetArgc}} will result in undefined
behavior.

\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{const char $\ast$}]{fmt}
\item[{}]{...}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_ocrPrintf}

A platform independent limited \code{printf} functionality.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{fmt} & NULL terminated C format string containing the
format of the output string\\
\hline
\mbox{\tt in} & \code{...} & A variable length list of arguments in agreement with
\code{fmt}\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
This function returns the number of bytes written out as a
\hyperlink{type_u32}{\code{u32}}.

\descr
OCR must support a wide variety of platforms including simulators that emulate
real systems. Often, core functionality provided by standard C libraries are not
available on all platforms, and, as a result, an OCR program cannot depend on
these functions. There was one case, however, where it was felt support was
critical: basic printf. This function supports basic printing functionality
and supports the following format specifiers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Strings using \code{\%s};
\item 32-bit integers using \code{\%d}, \code{\%u}, \code{\%x} and \code{\%X};
\item 64-bit integers using \code{\%ld}, \code{\%lu}, \code{\%lx}, \code{\%lX},
  and versions with two `l';
\item 64-bit pointers using \code{\%p};
\item Floating point numbers using \code{\%f}, \code{\%e} and \code{\%E};
\item The `\#' flag is supported for \code{\%x}, \code{\%lx} and \code{\%llx};
\item Precision modifiers are also supported for \code{\%f}, \code{\%e} and \code{\%E}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
A conformant implementation may limit the number of characters in the
output string.

%% GUID MANAGEMENT API
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{GUID management}
\index{GUID management API}
\label{sec:OCRGuidManagement}

GUIDs are opaque values used to uniquely identify OCR objects. In
previous versions of OCR, GUID values could be safely cast to 64-bit
values. To preserve the runtime's freedom in encoding information into
GUIDs, users can no longer rely on the ability to convert GUIDs to
64-bit values and must instead use the provided functions to
manipulate GUIDs.

\subsection{Macros for printing GUIDs}
It is often desirable in both applications and runtime to
print the value of a GUID for debugging purposes. Under previous
assumptions that GUIDs were \code{unsigned long} values, they were printed using
the \code{"\%PRIx64"} placeholder. Since GUIDs are opaque, their size
cannot be assumed and format specifiers are therefore provided to
properly print GUIDs.

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{GUIDF}
  \small \emph{Format placeholder representing a GUID.}
\item \code{GUIDA(guid)}
  \small \emph{Expands guid value into format arguments
  corresponding to the GUIDF format placeholder.}
\end{itemize}

The following snippet shows how to print a GUID:
\begin{ocrsnip}
ocrPrintf("DB Guid "GUIDF" acquired by "GUIDF"\n", GUIDA(db.guid), GUIDA(edt.guid));
\end{ocrsnip}

Note that the \code{GUIDF} format placeholder macro may actually expand into
multiple concrete format placeholders. Likewise, the \code{GUIDA} macro may
expand its single GUID argument into multiple arguments for a format function's
argument list, corresponding to the number of concrete placeholders included
by the \code{GUIDF} macro.

\section{Data block management}
\index{Data block management APIs}
\label{sec:OCRDataBlockManagement}

Data blocks are the only form of non-\/ephemeral storage and are therefore
the only way to ``share'' data between E\-D\-Ts. Conceptually, data blocks
are contiguous chunks of memory that have a start address and a size.
They also have the following characteristics\-:
\begin{itemize}
\item all memory within the data block is accessible from the start-\/address
  using an offset (ie\-: addresses \mbox{[}start-\/address; start-\/address+size\mbox{[}
  uniquely and totally address the entire data-\/block);
\item a data block is non-\/overlapping with other distinct data blocks
\item the pointer to the start of a data block is only valid between the start
of the E\-D\-T (or the data block creation) and the corresponding \code{ocrDbRelease}
(or the end of the E\-D\-T).
\end{itemize}

The following macros and enums are used with OCR data blocks.
\begin{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrInDbAllocator_t}{\code{enum ocrInDbAllocator\_t}} containing:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \code{NO\_ALLOC} The data block is not used as a heap
  \end{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrDbAccessMode_t}{\code{enum ocrDbAccessMode\_t}}
  containing the four access modes. The
  meaning of the access modes is given in Section~\ref{sec:data blocks}:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_RW}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_EW}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_RO}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_CONST}
    \item \code{DB\_MODE\_NULL}
  \end{itemize}
\item \code{DB\_DEFAULT\_MODE} which is an alias of \code{DB\_MODE\_RW}
\item \code{DB\_PROP\_NONE} which specifies no special properties on the data block
\item \code{DB\_PROP\_NO\_ACQUIRE} which specifies that the data block should
  not be acquired on creation
\end{itemize}

%% This is a repeat of sec:data blocks. Keeping for now commented.

%% These are the modes with which an EDT can access a data block.
%% OCR currently supports four modes:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item \code{DB\_MODE\_RW} Read-Write (default mode): The EDT is stating that it
%% may read from and write-to the data block. The user is responsible for
%% synchronizing between EDTs that could potentially write to the same data block
%% concurrently.
%% \item \code{DB\_MODE\_EW} Exclusive-Write (EW): The EDT requires that it be
%% the only one writing to the data block. The runtime will not schedule any other
%% EDT that accesses the same data block in RW or EW mode concurrently.
%% This can limit parallelism.
%% \item \code{DB\_MODE\_RO} Read-Only: The EDT is stating that it will only read
%% from the data block. The runtime will not enforce this restriction but the
%% visibility of any writes done by the EDT is undefined. The runtime also does
%% not guarantee that concurrent writes to the data block from other EDTs
%% will not be visible. In other words, another concurrent EDT in EW or RW mode may
%% concurrently access the data block and modify it while this EDT is accessing it in
%% RO mode.
%% \item \code{DB\_MODE\_CONST} Constant: Similarly to the RO mode, the EDT is
%% again stating that it will not write to the data block. In this mode, however,
%% the runtime guarantees that the data block seen by the EDT will not be modified
%% by other concurrent EDTs. Similarly to the RO mode, the visibility of any writes
%% by this EDT (in violation of the ``contract'') is undefined.

\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected or the following error codes:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item OCR\_EINVAL ({\bf immediate}): The arguments passed (flags, allocator, etc.) were
  not valid
\item 0: Successful
\item OCR\_ENOMEM ({\bf deferred}): The runtime could not provide a data block of size
  'len' due to insufficient memory
\item OCR\_EBUSY ({\bf deferred}): A resource required for this call was busy. A retry
  is possible
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
This function is used to create the basic unit of data in OCR: the
data block. Unless DB\_PROP\_NO\_ACQUIRE is specified in \code{flags}, this
function also acquires the newly created data block and returns a
pointer to the start of the data block in \code{addr}.

The created data block:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Will always be 8-byte aligned
\item Will not necessarily be zeroed out; the value of the created
  data block is undefined;
\item Will have a GUID that is unique from this call until the user
  calls \code{ocrDbDestroy()} on this data block.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using the DB\_PROP\_NO\_ACQUIRE flag is recommended to allow the
  runtime to make placement decisions for newly created
  data blocks. Not specifying this flag may result in a sub-optimal
  memory placement for the created data block.
\item When DB\_PROP\_NO\_ACQUIRE is specified, a conformant
  implementation may choose not to create the data block immediately
  and instead create it lazily before the using EDT runs.
\item Like all GUIDs, the uniqueness of a data block's GUID is not
  necessarily unique throughout the entire program. A data block's
  GUID is guaranteed unique only as long as the data block exists
  (between \code{ocrDbCreate()} and \code{ocrDbDestroy()}).

\label{func_ocrDbDestroy}

Request for the destruction of a data block. All created data blocks should be

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected or the following error codes:

\item OCR\_EPERM ({\bf deferred}): The data block was already destroyed
\item OCR\_EINVAL ({\bf deferred}): The GUID passed as argument does not refer to
  a valid data block
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
OCR does not perform automatic garbage collection; all created data blocks therefore
need to be explicitly destroyed by the user. This function will request the
destruction of a data block but said destruction will be delayed until all
EDTs that have acquired the data block have released it (either explicitly with
\hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease()}} or by transitioning to the
\emph{released} state).

This function does not need to be called by an EDT that has acquired the data block.
If the EDT did acquire the data block, however, this function will implicitly
release it (equivalent to calling \hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease()}}.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Not all instances of the errors indicated by the error codes can be caught. In
other words, attempting the destroy a data block multiple times may result in the
return of an error code but may also result in undefined behavior.

At the end of an OCR program, all data blocks are destroyed by the OCR runtime.

\begin{DoxyParamCaption}
\item[{{\bf ocr\-Guid\-\_\-t}}]{db}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_ocrDbRelease}

An EDT acquires a data block either on creation with \hyperlink{func_ocrDbCreate}{\code{ocrDbCreate()}}
or implicitly when it transitions to the \emph{ready} state. All acquired data blocks
will be implicitly released by the runtime when the EDT transitions to the
\emph{released} state but they can be released earlier using this function.
Releasing a data block indicates that the EDT no longer has use for it and also
enables other EDTs to ``see'' the eventual changes to the data block (release consistency).

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & \code{db} & GUID of the data block to release\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected or the following error codes:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item OCR\_EINVAL ({\bf immediate}): The GUID passed as argument does not refer to a
  valid data block
\item OCR\_EACCESS ({\bf immediate}): The calling EDT has not acquired the data block
  and therefore cannot release it
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
This function is critical in ensuring proper memory ordering in OCR. A data block
can be ``shared'' with another EDT B by satisfying an event that B depends on. B
is only guaranteed to see the changes made to the data block by this EDT if this
EDT releases the data block before satisfying the event B depends on with this
data block.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Once the EDT releases a data block, it can no longer read or write to it (the
pointer it had to it should be considered invalid). Violating this rule will
result in undefined behavior. A consequence of this is that a data block can
only be released at most once by an EDT.

\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_ocrDbDowngradeRelease}

This function allows for any writes made to a data block in the current EDT
to be \textit{released} (in terms of OCR's release consistency memory model)
while still allowing the data block to be read later in the current EDT.
In contrast, a call to \hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease()}}
indicates the end of both write and read access to the target data block
within the current EDT.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & \code{db} & GUID of the data block to downgrade/release\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected or the following error codes:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item OCR\_EINVAL ({\bf deferred}): The GUID passed as argument does not refer to a
  valid data block
\item OCR\_EACCESS ({\bf immediate}): The calling EDT has not acquired the data block
  and therefore cannot downgrade/release it
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
OCR's release-consistency memory model requires a \textit{release}
operation on a data block for synchronization, ensuring that writes to that data block
are visible by all EDTs ordered after the \textit{release} operation.
For a data block that is acquired in a writable mode by the current EDT,
this function performs a \textit{release} operation
(making all preceding writes visible in terms of the memory model);
however, the current EDT retains read-only access to the data block
by \textit{downgrading} the data block's access mode to a read-only
access mode (i.e., \code{DB\_MODE\_RO} or \code{DB\_MODE\_CONST}).
The user should assume that the mode for the downgraded data block
is \code{DB\_MODE\_RO} but conformant implementations may downgrade
certain data blocks to \code{DB\_MODE\_CONST}.
If the target data block is already in a read-only access mode,
then this function does nothing.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Unlike \hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease()}},
it is safe to call this function multiple times with the same target data block
within a single EDT. The target data block can later be fully released via
a call to \hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease()}},
otherwise it will be released implicitly at the end of the current EDT.

Events are used to coordinate the execution of tasks and to

execution of an OCR program.

The following macros and enums are used with OCR events:
\begin{itemize}
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrEventTypes_t}{\code{enum ocrEventTypes\_t}} containing the types of supported events. The
meaning of these event types is given in Section~\ref{sec:Event}:

  \end{itemize}
%% \code{OCR\_EVENT\_ONCE\_T} - \emph{Once} Event: A ONCE event simply passes along a satisfaction on its
%% unique pre-slot to its post-slot. Once all OCR objects linked to its post-slot have been satisfied,
%% the ONCE event is automatically destroyed.
%% \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_IDEM\_T} - \emph{Idempotent} Event: An IDEM event also passes along a satisfaction on its
%% unique pre-slot to its post-slot. The IDEM event persists until ocrEventDestroy() is explicitly called on it.
%% It can only be satisfied once and subsequent satisfactions are ignored.
%% \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_STICKY\_T} - \emph{Sticky} Event: A STICKY event is identical to an IDEM event except that
%% multiple satisfactions result in an error.
%% \item \code{OCR\_EVENT\_LATCH\_T} - \emph{Latch} Event: A LATCH event has two pre-slots: a INCR and a DECR.
%% Each slot is associated with an internal monotonically increasing counter that starts at 0.
%% On each satisfaction of one of the pre-slots, the counter for that slot is incremented by 1.
%% When both counters are equal (and non-zero), the post-slot of the latch event is triggered.
%% Any data block passed along its pre-slots is ignored. A LATCH event is similarly persistent
%% as a ONCE event and is automatically destroyed when its post-slot is triggered.
\item \hypertarget{type_ocrLatchEventSlots}{\code{enum ocrLatchEventSlots\_t}} containing constants to

Satisfy the specified pre-slot of an event thereby potentially causing waiting
EDTs to become \emph{runnable}. This function is the primary method of
synchronization in OCR.

\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected or the following error codes:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item OCR\_ENOMEM ({\bf deferred}): The runtime could not satisfy the event due to insufficent
  memory
\item OCR\_EINVAL ({\bf deferred}): \code{eventGuid} or \code{dataGuid} do not refer
  to valid event or data block GUIDs respectively
\item OCR\_EPERM ({\bf deferred}): The event has already been satisfied and does not support
  multiple satisfactions or a data block was passed to an event which does
  not take arguments
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
Satisfying the pre-slot of an event will potentially trigger the satisfaction of
its post-\/slot depending on its trigger rule:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \emph{Once}, \emph{idempotent} and \emph{sticky} events will
  satisfy their post-slot upon satisfaction of their pre-slot
\item \emph{Latch} events will trigger if and only if the number of
  satisfactions on both their pre-slots is equal. See Section~\ref{sec:Event} for
  more detail.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The \code{dataGuid} argument is used to associate a data block with the event.
\emph{Once}, \emph{idempotent} and \emph{sticky} events will pass this data block
down their post-slot. An EDT connected to the post-slot of the event (or the post-slot
of a chain of events connected to this event) will acquire the data block
associated with this event when it transitions to the \emph{ready} state.
A data block passed to a \emph{latch} event is ignored.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
OCR's memory model (see Section~\ref{sec:MemoryModel}) imposes that, to guarantee
the visibility of the writes to a data block passed to an event (and therefore
potentially immediately acquired by an EDT), data blocks need to be
\emph{released} with \hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease}} prior to
the satisfaction of the event. Failure to follow this rule will result in
undefined behavior. Note that data blocks written to by a preceding EDT will already
have been released when that EDT finished and moved to the \emph{release} stage.

\section{Task management}
\index{Event Driven Task management API}
\label{sec:OCRTaskManagement}

Event driven tasks -- EDTs -- act as the task abstraction in OCR, and all
program computations are expressed using E\-D\-Ts.

A support type for EDTs is the EDT template which factor out some information
about EDTs. To create an EDT, an EDT template first needs to be created. The EDT
template can be reused for all instances of an EDT of the same type.

The following macros and enums are used with OCR tasks.
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{EDT\_PROP\_NONE} which specifies no special properties
  for the creation of an EDT
\item \code{EDT\_PROP\_FINISH} which specifies that the created EDT
  is a \emph{finish} EDT
\item \code{EDT\_PARAM\_UNK} which specifies that the number of
  parameters or dependences to an EDT template is unknown and each EDT will
  specify the number of parameters or dependences. This allows a single template
  to be created for EDTs that can take a varying number of parameters or dependences.
\end{itemize}

The prototype of an EDT function is given by
\hypertarget{type_ocrEdt_t}{
  \hypertarget{type_ocrGuid_t}{ocrGuid\_t} (\code{$\ast$ocrEdt\_t})(

and all of its descendent EDTs (the closure of all EDTs created in this EDT and
its children) have completed execution. For a non finish EDT, the post-slot of
this event will be satisfied when the EDT completes execution and will carry the
data block returned by the EDT. If NULL, no event will be associated with the
EDT's post-slot. Note that in all cases, the event returned is an event that
is automatically destroyed on satisfaction. It is therefore crucial to ensure that all
waiters on this event are set up properly \emph{before} the EDT transitions to the
\emph{runnable} state.\\

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected or the following error codes:

\item OCR\_EINVAL ({\bf deferred}): The GUID specifying the template is invalid or the number
  of parameters or pre-slots are invalid
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
The EDT is created based on the function provided during the creation of its template.
It is required that the number of parameters (\code{paramc}) and number of
pre-slots (\code{depc}) be resolved at this time. In other words, the number of
parameters and dependences must be explicitly specified at this time.
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If the EDT is created with all its pre-slots specified and resolved, it may execute
immediately which means that the GUIDs returned (\code{guid} and \code{outputEvent})
may be invalid by the time this function returns. It is the responsibility of
the programmer to ensure, if he needs to use these returned values, that the EDT
cannot start until a later time (by inserting a ``fake'' pre-slot for example).

\label{func_ocrEdtDestroy}

EDTs are automatically destroyed after they execute. This call provides a way
to explicitly destroy a created EDT if the programmer later realizes that it
will never become \emph{runnable}.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt in}  & \code{guid} & GUID of the EDT to destroy\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\descr
Most programmers will not have use for this function as OCR implicitly destroys all
EDTs that execute. There are some cases, however, where an EDT is created and the
programmer later realizes that the task will never execute. This function allows the
programmer to reclaim the memory used by the EDT. If the destroyed EDT is a
descendant of a finish EDT, the destruction preserves the finish EDT's property --
i.e., its latch event is updated so that the finish EDT is allowed to trigger
its post-slot as if the destroyed EDT was not part of its finish scope.
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Destroying an EDT that is in the \emph{runnable} state or later will result in
undefined behavior.

If the EDT had an associated \code{outputEvent}, that event will also be explicitly
destroyed.
\end{DoxyNote}

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected. There are no error codes for this function.

\section{Dependence management}
\label{sec:OCRDependenceManagement}
\index{Dependence management@{Dependence management}}

At the core of OCR is the concept of a directed acyclic graph that represents the evolving
state of an OCR program. EDTs become runnable once their dependences are met.
These dependences can be set explicitly when creating the EDT or dynamically using
the functions from this section of the API.

Adds a dependence between two OCR objects. Concretely, this will link the post-slot
of the \code{source} object to the \code{slot}$^{th}$ pre-slot of \code{destination}.
When a dependence exists between post-slot $A$ and pre-slot $B$, when $A$ becomes
satisfied, $B$ will also become satisfied.

which the EDT will access the data block. If \code{destination} is an event, this
value is ignored.\\

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected or the following error codes:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item OCR\_EINVAL ({\bf deferred}): \code{slot} is invalid
\item OCR\_ENOPERM ({\bf deferred}): \code{source} and \code{destination} cannot be linked with
  a dependence (for example, if \code{destination} is a data block)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\descr
The following dependences can be added:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Event to event: The destination event's pre-slot will become satisfied
  upon satisfaction of the source event's post-slot. Any data block associated
  with the source event's post-slot will be associated with the sink event's pre-slot,
  except when the sink event is a latch event. This allows the formation of event chains.
\item Event to EDT: Upon satisfaction of the source event's post-slot, the EDT's
  pre-slot will be satisfied. When the runtime transitions the EDT from the
  \emph{runnable} to \emph{ready} state, the data block associated with the
  post-slot of the event will be acquired using the \code{mode} specified.
\item Data block to event: Adding a dependence between a data block and an
  event will result in the eventual satisfaction of the event with the data block;
  i.e., \code{ocrAddDependence(db, evt, slot, mode)} is
  similar to \hyperlink{func_ocrEventSatisfySlot}{
  \code{ocrEventSatisfySlot}}\code{(evt, db, slot)},
  but the satisfaction of the target event is not guaranteed to happen synchronously.
\item Data block to EDT: This represents a pure data dependence. Adding a
  dependence between a data block and an EDT immediately satisfies the pre-slot
  of the EDT. When the runtime transitions the EDT from the \emph{runnable}
  to the \emph{ready} state, the data block will be acquired using the
  \code{mode} specified.
\item NULL\_GUID to event or EDT: This is equivalent to ``data block to event''
  or ``data block to EDT'' where the data is non-existent.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that an EDT instance may legally have multiple pre-slots satisfied with the same
data block if those dependences have the same access mode. An EDT instance acquiring the
same data block through multiple pre-slots, but with differing access modes, results in
undefined behavior. The user is always responsible for ensuring that each data block is
explicitly released (via \hyperlink{func_ocrDbRelease}{\code{ocrDbRelease}}) at most once
per EDT instance.
