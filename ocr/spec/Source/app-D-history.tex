\item[September 2014] Release of OCR 0.9 including the first version
  of this specification.
\item[April 2015] Release of OCR 0.95.  Fixed some typos in the spec and
cleaned up some subtle flaws in the memory model.
\item[June 2015] Release of OCR 1.0.0. Restructured the specification for clarity and
updated the API to make the names of the memory modes more intuitive. Also moved
the API documentation from doxygen to human-readable TEX with proper specification
language.
