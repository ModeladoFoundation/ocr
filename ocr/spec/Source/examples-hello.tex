This example illustrates the most basic OCR program: a single function
that prints the message ``Hello World!'' on the screen and exits.
%%%%
\subsection{Code example}
The following code will print the string ``Hello World!'' to the
standard output and exit. Note that this program is fully functional
(ie: there is no need for a \texttt{main} function).

\begin{ocrsnip}
#include <ocr.h> (@ \label{line:HW_include} @)

ocrGuid_t mainEdt(u32 paramc, u64* paramv, u32 depc, ocrEdtDep_t depv[]) { (@ \label{line:HW_mainEdt} @)
    PRINTF('Hello World!\n'); (@ \label{line:HW_printf}@)
    ocrShutdown(); (@ \label{line:HW_shutdown}@)
    return NULL_GUID;
}
\end{ocrsnip}

\subsubsection{Details}
The \texttt{ocr.h} file included on Line~\ref{line:HW_include}
contains all of the main OCR APIs. Other more experimental or extended
APIs are also located in the \texttt{extensions/} folder of the
include directory.

EDT's signature is shown on Line~\ref{line:HW_mainEdt}. A special EDT,
named \texttt{mainEdt} is called by the runtime if the programmer does not
provide a \texttt{main} function\footnote{Note that if the programmer
  \emph{does} provide a \texttt{main} function, it is the
  responsability of the programmer to properly initialize the runtime,
  call the first EDT to execute and properly shutdown the runtime. This
  method is detailed in TODO and is not recommended as it is not
  platform portable.}.

The \texttt{ocrShutdown} function called on
Line~\ref{line:HW_shutdown} should be called once and only once by all
OCR programs to indicate that the program has terminated. The runtime
will then shutdown and any non-executed EDTs at that time are not
guaranteed to execute.
