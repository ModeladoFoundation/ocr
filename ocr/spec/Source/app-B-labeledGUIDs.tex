\section{Labeled GUIDs}
GUIDs are used to identify OCR objects and are opaque to the
programmer. A consequence of this opacity is that if two EDTs need to
use a common object, they both need to have a-priori knowledge of the
GUID for that object. If the object was created much earlier in the
execution flow, both EDTs therefore need to have the GUID passed down
either through data blocks or parameters. This is inconvenient and can
lead to a glut of parameters and data blocks solely dedicated to
passing down GUIDs.

Labeled GUIDs provide a mechanism by which a programmer can
reason about GUIDs; an API is provided to ``translate'' a programmer
defined index range into GUIDs. The transformation is such that all
EDTs invoking this API with the same input will get the same resulting
GUID. In effect, EDTs no longer need to agree on an opaque GUID (which
requires a-priori knowledge) but only on a common index which can be
achieved only through semantic knowledge of the
application. Concretely, this is the difference between ``the
`neighbor' EDT you need to communicate with has GUID X'' and
``give me X, the GUID of my neighbor Y''.
%%%%
\subsection{Usage scenarios}
Several usage scenarios have been identified for labeled GUIDs. These
scenarios are by no means exhaustive but have driven the current
design.
%%%
\subsubsection{Referring to a previously created OCR object}
In this scenario, a root EDT \texttt{R} creates a sink EDT \texttt{S}
(for example a reduction EDT) and then spawns multiple child
EDTs which will in turn spawn EDTs which will satisfy a slot of
\texttt{S}. Without labeled GUIDs, \texttt{S}'s GUID would need to be
passed down to each and every producer. Labeled GUIDs allow the
producers to ask the runtime for \texttt{S}'s GUID.
%%%
\subsubsection{Unsynchronized object creation}
Traditionally, if an EDT wants to refer to an OCR object, that
object's creation needs to have happened before its use, and,
conversely, the object's eventual destruction needs to happen after
its use. In a situation where two EDTs \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}
need to use an object, that object's creation needs to happen in a
third EDT \texttt{C} which happened before \texttt{A} and
\texttt{B}. In other words, there is a dependence chain between
\texttt{C} and \texttt{A} as well as one between \texttt{C} and
\texttt{B}.

This behavior is not always desired. For example, suppose an algorithm
where, at each iteration, each EDT creates its ``clone'' for the next
iteration; in other words, the algorithm avoids a global barrier
between iterations. Suppose that within an iteration, an EDT \texttt{B}
depends on another EDT \texttt{A}. Without labeled GUIDs, \texttt{B}
and \texttt{A} would have no way on agreeing on the event to use to
synchronize. Labeled GUIDs allow both \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} to
``create'' the event and the runtime will guarrantee that {\bf a)}
only one event is created and {\bf b)} both \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}
get the same GUID for that event.
%%%%
\subsection{API}
The following enum is used to specify the types of objects a GUID can
refer to:
\hypertarget{type_ocrGuidUserKind}{\code{enum ocrGuidUserKind}}
containing:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{GUID\_USER\_NONE} The GUID is invalid and does not refer
  to any object.
\item \code{GUID\_USER\_DB} The GUID refers to a data block.
\item \code{GUID\_USER\_EDT} The GUID refers to an EDT.
\item \code{GUID\_USER\_EDT\_TEMPLATE} The GUID refers to an EDT
  template.
\item \code{GUID\_USER\_EVENT\_ONCE} The GUID refers to a ONCE event.
\item \code{GUID\_USER\_EVENT\_IDEM} The GUID refers to an IDEMPOTENT
  event.
\item \code{GUID\_USER\_EVENT\_STICKY} The GUID refers to a STICKY
  event.
\item \code{GUID\_USER\_EVENT\_LATCH} The GUID refers to a LATCH
  event.
\end{itemize}

The primary functions supporting labeled GUIDs are listed below.
These functions allow the user to reserve a flat range of GUIDs,
and then retrieve a particular GUID by its index in that range.
The user may decide to map an N-dimensional tuple space
onto the flat index space for a labeled GUID range.

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected. There are no other defined error codes for this call.

\descr
This function assumes that the programmer has already calculated
the target index in the GUID range.
This index is then used to index into the GUID
space reserved by the
\hyperlink{func_ocrGuidRangeCreate}{ocrGuidRangeCreate} call.

\item[{{\bf ocr\-Guid\-\_\-t}}]{guid}
\end{DoxyParamCaption}
)}}
\label{func_ocrGetGuidKind}

This function returns the type of OCR object (event, data block, EDT)
that the GUID refers to or \code{OCR\_GUID\_NONE} if the GUID is
invalid.

\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\tt out} & \code{outKind} & The kind of object this GUID refers to.\\

\hline
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

\returns
0 if no immediate error was detected. There are no other defined error codes for this call.
Note that returning \code{OCR\_GUID\_NONE} is considered a successful execution.

\descr
With labeled GUIDs, having a GUID does not necessarily mean that it
refers to a valid object. This function addresses this concern by
determining if a GUID refers to a valid object. Note that the
information returned may be stale if concurrent creation/destruction
of the object is happening.
%%%%
\subsection{Other API changes}
The creation calls are all modified to allow them to accept a GUID as
input (as opposed to just output). In the current implementation, events, EDTs
and data blocks can be labeled. There are some restrictions on using labeled EDTs,
namely: {\bf a)} labeled EDTs cannot have dependences listed in the create call,
{\bf b)} labeled EDTs cannot request an output event and {\bf c)} if an
instance of a labeled EDT
is created within a finish scope, that instance will only be registered in
one of the finish scopes if the instance is created in multiple places. To use
labeled GUIDs, the programmer should pass in the GUID returned by
\hyperlink{func_ocrGuidFromIndex}{ocrGuidFromIndex} as the first argument of
an \code{ocrXXCreate} call and also add an
additional flag to the properties field of that call:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{GUID\_PROP\_IS\_LABELED} The input GUID to the call should
  be used as the GUID for the created object. Note that with this
  flag, the user is responsible for ensuring that only one EDT creates
  the object (in other words, this is a ``trust me'' mode) where the
  runtiem incurs very little cost to creating the object.
\item \code{GUID\_PROP\_CHECK} Similar to
  \code{GUID\_PROP\_IS\_LABELED}, this property will also cause the
  use of labeled GUIDs. However, the runtime ensures that the object
  is only created once. In other words, other EDTs trying to create
  the same object (same GUID) will get an error code and know that the
  object has already been created.
\item \code{GUID\_PROP\_BLOCK} This property blocks the creation call
  until the object no longer exists and can therefore be
  recreated. This property is not in line with the non-blocking
  philosophy of OCR but is there to support legacy programming models.
\end{itemize}
%%%%
\subsection{Other considerations}
This extension is a work in progress.
For example,
one issue with this proposal (and with many of the other creation
calls) is that the creation of the GUID may be delayed and require
communication. This is particularly true with labeled GUIDs as the
runtime is constrained in the GUID is can use to create an object. One
proposal is to have the notion of a local identifier which could only
be used inside an EDT. This would allow creation calls to return
immediately and allow the runtime to defer all long-latency calls till
after the EDT finishes.

Normally, the exact definition of the point in time that an object is
destroyed is not necessary. The object cannot be used after the
destroy call was made or after it was supposed to be destroyed
automatically. It is up to the runtime to determine the right time to
reclaim the object's resources. However, if the object is created using
a labeled GUID, it is possible to re-use the GUID to create another
object. When the create call is made with \code{GUID\_PROP\_CHECK},
the outcome depends on the state of the object. A new object is only
created if an object with the same GUID was not created elsewhere
or if any such object was already destroyed. It's therefore necessary
to establish a clear relation between the destruction of the object
and the create call. For the purpose of labeled GUIDs, all objects are
considered to be completely destroyed by a call to the appropriate
destroy function or at the moment they should be automatically
destroyed. EDTs are exception to this rule. An EDT releases its
labeled GUID for re-use at some point after it becomes ready, but
before it starts running.
