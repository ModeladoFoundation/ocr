\chapter{The OCR API }
\label{chap:OCRAPI}

This chapter describes the syntax and behavior of the OCR API functions, and is divided
into the following sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item The core types, macros and error codes used in OCR.
(\specref{sec:OCRtypesmacros})

\item A description of OCR main entry point: \code{mainEdt}.
(\specref{sec:mainEDT})

\item Supporting functions.
(\specref{sec:supportFuncs})

\item Functions to create, destroy, and otherwise manage the contents of OCR data blocks.
(\specref{sec:OCRDataBlockManagement})

\item Functions to manage events in OCR.
(\specref{sec:OCREventManagement})

\item Functions to create and destroy tasks in OCR.
(\specref{sec:OCRTaskManagement})

\item Functions to manage dependences between OCR objects.
(\specref{sec:OCRDependenceManagement})
\end{itemize}

Types, constants, function prototypes and anything else required to use the
OCR API are made available through the \code{ocr.h} include file. You do not
need to include any other files unless using extended or experimental
features (described in the appendices).
% This is the end of ch2-intro.tex of the OCR specification.
