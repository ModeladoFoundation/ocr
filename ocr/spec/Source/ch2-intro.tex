\chapter{OCR API Documentation}
\label{chap:OCRAPI}


This chapter describes the syntax and behavior of the OCR API functions, and is divided
into the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item The core types, macros and error codes used in OCR.
(\specref{sec:OCRtypesmacros})

\item Functions to create, destroy, and otherwise manage the contents of OCR datablocks.
(\specref{sec:OCRdataBlockManagement})

\item Functions to manage events in OCR.
(\specref{sec:OCReventManagement})

\item Functions to create EDTs and  destroy EDTs
(\specref{sec:OCREDTManagement})

\item Functions to manage dependences between OCR objects.
(\specref{sec:OCRdependenceManagement})

\end{itemize}

Types, constants, function prototypes and anything else required to use the
OCR API are made available through the \code{ocr.h} include file.  You do not
need to include any other files unless using extended or experimental
features (described in the appendices).
