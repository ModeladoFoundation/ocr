                 Because an object can be modified via any alias, object
                 oriented programs are hard to understand, maintain, and
                 analyse. Flexalias is a conceptual model of
                 inter-object relationships which limits the visibility
                 of changes via aliases, allowing objects to be aliased
                 but mitigating the undesirable effects of aliasing.
                 Flexalias can be checked statically using programmer
                 supplied {"}aliasing modes{"} and imposes no run-time
                 overhead. Using flexalias, programs can incorporate
                 mutable objects, immutable values, and updatable
                 collections of shared objects, in a natural object
                 oriented programming style, while avoiding the problems

  abstract =     "Usually, programming languages are used according to
                  conventions and rules. Although general rules can be
                  en-forced by lint-like tools, there is a large class
                  of rules that cannot be built into such tools
                  because they result from particular design decisions
                  or the reuse of existing software. This paper
                  presents a system, called CoffeeStrainer, that
                  statically checks programmer-specified constraints
                  on Java programs. Unlike previous approaches, which
                  only support constraints that apply to definitions
                  of types, CoffeeStrainer additionally supports a
                  second class of con-straints which apply to all uses
                  of a type. Both classes of constraints play an
                  important role for object-oriented class libraries
                  and frameworks, which often make assumptions on
                  their correct use.",
