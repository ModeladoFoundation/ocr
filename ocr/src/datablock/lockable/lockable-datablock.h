/**
 * @brief Datablock implementation based on locking.
 *
 * The lock approach allows coherent distributed read-write by serializing
 * accesses to the datablock across locations, while allowing intra-location
 * parallelism for the grantee. The implementation allows distributed reads
 * to process in parallel on any location.
 *
 *
 * EAGER DB hint:
 *
 * The implementation also supports the EAGER datablock hint.
 *
 * The hint is meant to convey that when an event is satisfied with the DB, the DAG
 * structure provides enough guarantees that the DB can be eagerly delivered to
 * its consumer EDTs. In other words, the runtime does not need to ensure its coherence.
 *
 * The hint is 'unsafe' meaning that when incorrectly used, it may affects the correctness
 * of the application.
 * To be correct, the execution of the producer EDT that writes to the EAGER DB and the
 * consumer EDT that reads MUST be properly ordered in the DAG. When done iteratively,
 * the user must properly ensure the consumer EDT at phase 'i' is done executing when
 * the producer EDT at phase 'i+1' executes. Otherwise there's a risk of the DB of
 * phase 'i' be erased by phase 'i+1' while the consumer is still using it.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Producer EDT (writer) and Consumer EDT (reader) are properly ordered
 * - Consumer EDT must NOT write to the DB. No coherence enforced !
 * - The satisfaction of an event with an EAGER DB is always asynchronous
 *
 * BKMS:
 * - The channel-event should be co-located with the consumer EDT so that the addDependence call
 *   is local. The satisfaction will be asynchronous, bundling both the satisfaction message and
 *   the datablock payload. On reception the eager DB current data is discarded and replaced with
 *   the incoming payload.
 * - It is better to keep reusing a datablock instance rather than keep creating/destroying new
 *   ones to avoid extra overheads.
 *
 * Limitations (reason):
 * - The EAGER hint is only honored when satisfying a channel event
 *   (avoids checking the hint for all events)
 * - The channel-event being satisfied with an eager DB must have a single dependence
 *   (just did not impl for multiple recipient, check nonCoherentLoc and waitersCount)
 *
