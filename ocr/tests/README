** About failing tests

Depending on your build of OCR and the configuration file used
some non-regression tests may fail. The reason for tests failing
may be an actual bug or the manifestation of a runtime limitation.

The 'unstable.*' files located in this folder allows to exclude
a set of non-regression test from the test run. Tests declared in
unstable files are either limitations or known issues being worked
on.

The following runs all the tests with the exclusion of all test-cases
mentioned in the 'unstable.x86-mpi-lockableDB' file

    ./ocrTests -unstablefile unstable.x86-mpi-lockableDB

The current naming convention is for unstable file is:

    unstable.ARCHITECTURE-DBTYPE

where 'ARCHITECTURE' is one of the names under ocr/build/ and
'DBTYPE' is 'regularDB' or 'lockableDB'
