This directory consists of files needed to verify that the XE & CE toolchains represent binary in the same way for OCR's structs
Just do make (after ensuring the toolchain paths are set up correctly).

tools/ consists of bits & pieces of tools needed to generate test.c
It's mostly auto-generated but manual intervention for small syntax fixings are needed.
If I have time, I'll revisit and make it cleaner. In the meantime, contact bala.seshasayee@intel.com for help with this
