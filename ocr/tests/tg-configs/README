- config-template.tg: the template TG configuration file to use to run the tests
                      WARNING: The file is a template used to generate a TG config file for EVERY test invocation
                      by appending its content to a freshly generated file.
- Makefile.tg: The makefile used to invoke the compilation and execution of TG programs.
               The makefile is generic and a number of variables such as SRCS and TARGET
               must be set by the caller to identify which test to compile and run.
