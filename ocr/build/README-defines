This file lists the defines that you can override when
compiling OCR to modify the way it is compiled. Default values
are provided in the code but can be overridden by setting
them in the CFLAGS_USER environment variable

                                                  to contain EDTs
MAX_PROFILER_LEVEL              512               For the runtime profiler, specifies
                                                  the maximum number of function nesting
OCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING           unset             Enable the naming of EDTs for easier
                                                  debuging
OCR_ENABLE_EDT_PROFILING        unset             Enable the collection of EDT statistics
                                                  in terms of R/W (only on x86; requires
                                                  OCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING)
OCR_MAX_MULTI_SLOT              1                 For HC tasks, defines the maximum
                                                  number of blocks of 64 slots that an

OCR_RUNTIME_PROFILER            unset             Enables the collection of profiling
                                                  information on the runtime (only on x86)
PRINTF_MAX                      1024              Maximum number of characters handled
                                                  by a single PRINTF
