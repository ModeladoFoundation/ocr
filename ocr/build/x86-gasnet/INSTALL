* Compiling OCR with GASNet support

Mandatory environment variable to be defined
    GASNET_ROOT             Path to the gasnet installation
    GASNET_CONDUIT          Name of GASNet conduit to use
    GASNET_TYPE             (seq|par)
    GASNET_EXTRA_LIBS       Extra linking dependences

The runtime build system tries to find the right GASNet library to link with
using the provided environment variables. One can accomodate extra dependences
throught the GASNET_EXTRA_LIBS.


* Running OCR programs with GASNet support

The 'ocrrun' command uses environment variable to determine how to spawn GASNet processes

Mandatory environment variables:
    GASNET_CONDUIT          Name of GASNet conduit to use

Optional environment variables:
    OCR_NUM_NODES           Number of GASNet process to spawn (must be coherent with OCR_NODEFILE)
    OCR_NODEFILE            Specifies a host file to spawn processes to (must be coherent with OCR_NUM_NODES)
    GASNET_LAUNCHER         Specify the name of the gasnet launcher (usually guessed from GASNET_CONDUIT)
    GASNET_IBV_SPAWNER      Set to 'ssh' or 'mpi' spawn for ibv conduit (default intel mpi)


* Running OCR tests with GASNet support

'ocrTests' needs to be able to both compile and run non-regression tests.

To get setup quickly the best is to keep environment variable previously defined to
build OCR: GASNET_ROOT, GASNET_CONDUIT, GASNET_TYPE, GASNET_EXTRA_LIBS

Then make sure to define the following mandatory variables:
    GASNET_CONDUIT          Name of GASNet conduit to use
    OCR_LDFLAGS             Linking flags for OCR applications to link with GASNet librarie
    PATH                    Updated PATH including ${GASNET_ROOT}/bin to use GASNet launchers

OCR_LDFLAGS can typically be defined as:

    export OCR_LDFLAGS="-L${GASNET_ROOT}/lib -lgasnet-${GASNET_CONDUIT}-${GASNET_TYPE} ${GASNET_EXTRA_LIBS}"


* Running OCR applications with GASNet support

OCR provides a makefile skeleton 'x86-gasnet' to build and run your applications.

- To compile the makefile needs the following environment variables to be defined:
    GASNET_ROOT, GASNET_CONDUIT, GASNET_TYPE, GASNET_EXTRA_LIBS

- Refer to the ocrrun section above for runtime environment variables.
