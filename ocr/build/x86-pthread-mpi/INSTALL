* Specify the MPI distribution to use

By default, the makefile will just use the first 'mpicc'
found in the environment's PATH variable.

The distribution to be used can be set through the
MPI_ROOT and MPI_LIB environment variables.

- MPI_ROOT: Defines the path where the MPI distribution is installed.

- MPI_LIB: Defines the name of the MPI library to link with, default is
"mpi". This may vary from one MPI distribution to another.
