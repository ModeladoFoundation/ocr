stencil1D.c implements a 1D dissapative stencil on a set of points
the initial data is 1s at each end and zero on the interior
there are three input parameters that are set in #define s
N is the number of worker EDTs
M is the number of points controlled by each EDT
I is the number of iterations

The can be changed and rerun.

There is a j.sh bash script that compiles and runs the code in all four modes
Or you can just run one of the four lines at the bottom
