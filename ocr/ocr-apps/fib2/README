This version of Fib requires the ENABLE_EXTENSION_LABELING to work.

It will only compute fib(X) once thereby limiting parallelism but demonstrating
the use of the labeling API.

There are blocks/events which are not freed/released in this code.

ONLY TESTED ON x86-pthread-x86
Running:

OCR_CONFIG=$PWD/default.cfg make -f Makefile.<OCR_TYPE> run <fib_num>

where fib_num is the optional number you want to run fibonacci for; default 10
