This directory contains scripts that post-process a run on Xeon-Phi to determine
EDTs whose datablocks can benefit from moving to MCDRAM. To use it,
1. Enable perfmon counters on Xeon-Phi by uncommenting ENABLE_EXTENSION_PERF
   build/x86-phi/ocr-config.h
2. Run the workload and pipe the output to a file
3. Pass the output file as argument to the highbw.sh script with the name of the application binary as optional second argument
4. The resultant order of EDTs determine the datablocks that could benefit from moving to MCDRAM
