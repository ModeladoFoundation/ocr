Usage Instruction for Communication Overhead analysis (distibuted MPI)
**********************************************************************

This analysis tool is used to gather communcation overhead
(measured in amount of bytes transfered per message) in an
app executed using x86-pthread-mpi

The following are required pre-execution:

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -Debug option needs to be set at DEBUG_LVL_WARN
    *NOTE: DEBUG_LVL_WARN is temporary and will be changed in the future.
     Using WARN level eliminates other DPRINTFs to speed up execution on
     large data sets.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory

-Application logging output must be redirected to
 to the /ocr/scripts/CommOverhead directory

 The command would look like: make -f Makefile.x86-pthread-mpi run > ~/xstack/ocr/scripts/CommOverhead/<log_ouput_file_name>

-Navigate to /ocr/scripts/CommOverhead, and run: python analyzeComm.py <log_ouput_file_name>
-The output will be called analysis.txt and will contain data transfer info for each message
 type observed in the execution log.
