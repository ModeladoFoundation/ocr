that workers begin seeking work and when they recieve work from the scheduler.
    -x86
    -x86-mpi
    -x86-phi

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -DOCR_MONITOR_ALLOCATOR must be set.
    -DOCR_TRACE_BINARY must be set.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory

-When building/running the application a configuration option must be prepended
 to the make command.

    The command would look like: CONFIG_FLAGS=--sysworker make -f Makefile.<platform_type> run

-When properly configured, one trace binary per policy domain will be created
 in: <application_directory>/install/<platform_type>


-Navigate to /ocr/scripts/TraceUtils and run:
    -make
    -./traceDecode <path_to_trace_binaries>/trace_* > <filename>

    -<filename> is a an appropriately formatted file expected by the overhead script.


-Navigate to /ocr/scripts/Allocator/ and run:
    ./analyzeiAllocator.py <filename>

    -This will create alloc_out.csv which contains time difference intervals for
        OCR_ALLOC_PDMALLOC, OCR_ALLOC_PDFREE, OCR_ALLOC_MEMALLOC, and OCR_ALLOC_MEMUNALLOC.
