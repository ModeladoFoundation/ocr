# Usage Instructions
##

This script postprocesses log data and generates a console
summary, and .csv readout of data overhead and execution
time overhead per EDT observed during app execution.  This
can be used as a lightweight way to get basic overhead data
and identify "hot" EDTs in an application.

Instructions:

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -Debug option needs to be set at DEBUG_LVL_VERB
    -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING must be set.
    -DOCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER must be set.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory.

-Before running an application an environment variable must be set via:
    -export ENABLE_VISUALIZER=yes

-NOTE: The above env. variable will issue -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING and
  -DOCR_OCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER to the targeted app only if you are compiling
  your program with the default common Makefile.  If you are using a custom
  Makefile, you must issue these compiler flags explicitely and use the config-generator
  script to create a config file using guid type COUNTED_MAP.

-Application logging output must be redirected to
 to the /ocr/scripts/EdtStats directory
    The command would look like: make -f Makefile.x86-pthread-x86 run > ~/xstack/ocr/scripts/EdtStats/<log_ouput_file_name>

-Navigate to ~/xstack/ocr/scripts/EdtStats, and run: python edtStats.py <log_ouput_file_name>

-Output will be a .csv file which can be opened in a spreadsheet program.
