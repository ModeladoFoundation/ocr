Tool for extracting relevant TG statistics from log files

Disclaimer: WIP, things will likely change


Pre-conditions
==============

    -The TG_ROOT environment variable must be correctly set
    -The application must be run targetting the "Energy.cfg" config file
    -The TG config file must have trace values RMD_TRACE_DUMP_STATS
     and RMD_TRACE_DUMP_PMU enabled (should be enabled by default)
    -For detailed information on gathering the correct logs visit:

        xstack.exascale-tech.com/wiki/index.php/FSIM_Performance_Statistics


Usage Instructions
==================

There are two usage options:

    python tgStats.py <path_to_tg_log_files_parent_directory> <options>

        Options:
            -h :  display inter-agent payload traffic heatmap (in bytes)

                y-axis: Source of load/store
                x-axis: Destination of load/store

                *NOTE: In order to display heatmap on the cluster you must add the -X flag
                       when ssh'ing into the machine and execute the script on bar1


        -The parent log directory is generated upon running an OCR application
         on TG in the /install/tg/ directory called "logs"

        -Generally the path will looks <apps_root>/<app>/install/tg/logs


Output
======

The script will produce several summary files:


    approximate_power_and_energy.txt

        -Summary of measured time, energy, and power values (totalled across all agents)
        -pJ / instruction breakdown of each XE

    energy_per_agent.txt

        -Breakdown of computational energy vs. non-computational energy.
        -Non-computational energy broken down into network energy, dynamic memory energy, and static memory energy
        -Percentage breakdown of each agents power consumption

    xe_pmu_counters_summary_block_<n>.txt

        -Displays PMU counters per XE on block <n>
        -One file per block will be produced

    isa_instuctions_summary.txt

        -Summary of assembly instruction counters
        -Categorized as:
            logical
            memory
            control
            float
            integer
            atomic
            bitwise
            misc

    total_net_traffic.txt

        - Summary of Agent to Agent data transfer for loads/stores/atomics at the block level, and DRAM level

    energy_breakdown.csv

        - Spreadsheet summarizing Total/Static/Dynamic/Network/Memory energy per agent

    instruction_breakdown.csv

        - Spreadsheet summarizing total instructions per XE categorized into general instruction type
