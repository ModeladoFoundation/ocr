# Usage Instructions
##

This tool produces data detailing time overheads incurred by each EDT
throughout various stages of thier life cycle, as well as absolute times
that workers begin seeking work and when they recieve work from the scheduler.
    -x86
    -x86-mpi

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -DOCR_MONITOR_SCHEDULER must be set.
    -DOCR_TRACE_BINARY must be set.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory

-When building/running the application a configuration option must be prepended
 to the make command.

    The command would look like: CONFIG_FLAGS=--sysworker make -f Makefile.<platform_type> run

-When properly configured, one trace binary per policy domain will be created
 in: <application_directory>/install/<platform_type>


-Navigate to /ocr/scripts/TraceUtils and run:
    -make
    -./traceDecode <path_to_trace_binaries>/trace_* > <filename>

    -<filename> is a an appropriately formatted file expected by the overhead script.


-Navigate to /ocr/scripts/schedOverhead/ and run:
    ./analyzeSchedOverhead.py <filename>


    -This will create two files per policy domain: timeData_pd#.csv and workActivityLog_pd#.csv

    -timeData_pd#.csv contains time difference intervals per EDT and are arranged as follows:

        Column A: EDT Guid
        Column B: EDT func. ptr.
        Column C: Time from EDT creation thruough EDT becoming runnable (All depv satisfied)
        Column D: Time from EDT becoming runnable through policy domain being notified (PD_MSG send)
        Column E: Time from PD_MSG send through time when PD_MSG received/processed
        Column F: Time from PD_MSG receive through time when scheduler module is invoked
        Column G: Time from scheduler invoke through when the EDT gets scheduled (placed on deque)
        Column H: Time from EDT being scheduled through the time the EDT gets taken from deque
        Column I: Time from EDT being taken taken through the time the EDT gets executed

        NOTE: this file is sorted by timestamp of EDT creation

    -workActivityLog_pd#.csv

        -Contains records for each time a worker begins seeking, and when it finds work.
         In seeking records, the total number of EDTs available at that point in time is also included.
