***********************************************************
Usage Instruction for Application Flowgraph
***********************************************************

This visualization tool represents an OCR application as a
directed acyclic graph, showing satisfactions between
EDTs and events.

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -Debug option needs to be set at DEBUG_LVL_INFO
    -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING must be set.
    -DOCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER must be set.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory.
    -NOTE: The default ocr-config GuidType (PTR) reuses guids, and is not compitable with this tool.
     GuidType of COUNTED_MAP is needed in the ocr-config file to use this tool.  There is a config-file
     in this directory that mirrors the default config, with COUNTED_MAP in place of PTR for GuidType.
     To use this config file, run the following:

        -export OCR_CONFIG=~/xstack/ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Flowgraph/x86_flowGraph.cfg

-Before running an application an environment variable must be set via:
    -export ENABLE_VISUALIZER=yes

-NOTE: The above env. variable will issue -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING and
  -DOCR_OCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER to the targeted app only if you are compiling
  your program with the default Makefile.  If you are using a custom Makefile,
  you must issue these compiler flags explicitely.

-Application logging output must be redirected to
 to the /ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Flowgraph directory
    The command would look like: make -f Makefile.x86-pthread-x86 run > ~/xstack/ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Flowgraph/<log_ouput_file_name>

-Navigate to ~/xstack/ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Flowgraph, and run: python flowgraph.py <log_ouput_file_name>
-The output will be an HTML file called flowgraph.html

-Copy html file to local machine, and open flowgraph.html in a web browser.
