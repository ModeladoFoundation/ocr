# Usage Instructions
##

This visualization tool represents an OCR application as a
directed acyclic graph, showing satisfactions between
EDTs and events.

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -Debug option needs to be set at DEBUG_LVL_INFO
    -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING must be set.
    -DOCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER must be set.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory.

-Before running an application an environment variable must be set via:
    -export ENABLE_VISUALIZER=yes

-NOTE: The above env. variable will issue -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING and
  -DOCR_OCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER to the targeted app only if you are compiling
  your program with the default Makefile.  If you are using a custom Makefile,
  you must issue these compiler flags explicitely, and use the config-generator
  script to create a config file using guid type COUNTED_MAP.

-Application logging output must be redirected to
 to the /ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Flowgraph directory
    The command would look like: make -f Makefile.x86 run > ~/xstack/ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Flowgraph/<log_ouput_file_name>

-Navigate to ~/xstack/ocr/scripts/Visualizer/Flowgraph, and run: python flowgraph.py <log_ouput_file_name>
-The output will be an HTML file called flowgraph.html

-NOTE: flowgraph.py depends on an external package called pygraph which can be
       found here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-graph-core/

-Copy html file to local machine, and open flowgraph.html in a web browser.
-NOTE: The html file depends on an external JavaScript package called visJs.
