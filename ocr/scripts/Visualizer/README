Usage Instruction for EDT Exectution Timeline
***********************************************************

This visualization tool records the timeline for thread
execution. It currently has a time.h dependency, thus
it is only supported on x86 architecture.

The following are required pre-execution:

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -Debug option needs to be set at DEBUG_LVL_INFO or higher
    -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING must be set.
    -DOCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER must be set.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory
-Before running an application an environment variable must be set via:
    export ENABLE_VISUALIZER=yes

-Application logging output must be redirected to
 to the /ocr/scripts directory as a text file named log.txt
    The command would look like: make -f Makefile.x86-pthread-x86 run > ../../scripts/Visualizer/log.txt

-Navigate to /ocr/scripts, and run: python timeline.py
-timeline.py will source stripExcessEvents.sh so the user
 need not.  The output is an HTML file called timeline.html
 which will display the visualizer
