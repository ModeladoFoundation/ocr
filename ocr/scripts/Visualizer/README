Usage Instruction for EDT Exectution Timeline
***********************************************************

This visualization tool records the timeline for thread
execution. It currently has a time.h dependency, thus
supported platforms are restricted to:
    -x86-pthread-x86
    -x86-pthread-mpi

-In ocr/build/common.mk:
    -Debug option needs to be set at DEBUG_LVL_INFO
    -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING must be set.
    -DOCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER must be set.

Script Instructions:

-Navigate to desired application directory
-Before running an application an environment variable must be set via:
    export ENABLE_VISUALIZER=yes

-*NOTE: The above env. variable will issue -DOCR_ENABLE_EDT_NAMING and
  -DOCR_OCR_ENABLE_VISUALIZER to the targeted app only if you are compiling
  your program with the default Makefile.  If you are using a custom Makefile,
  you must issue these compiler flags explicitely.

-Application logging output must be redirected to
 to the /ocr/scripts/Visualizer directory
    The command would look like: make -f Makefile.x86-pthread-x86 run > ../../scripts/Visualizer/<log_ouput_file_name>

-Navigate to /ocr/scripts/Visualizer, and run: python timeline.py <log_ouput_file_name>
-The output will be HTML files called timeline[*].html

-Copy html file(s) to local machine, and starting with timeline1.html, open in an internet browser.
