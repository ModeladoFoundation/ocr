Tool for visualizing frequency of memory allocations among
all levels of memory configured for OCR apps run targetting
the TG platform


Pre-conditions - OCR application
==============

    - OCR must be built with the OCR_ENABLE_MEMORY_HEATMAP
      option defined, located in <OCR_ROOT>/build/common.mk

    - It is recommended that you add "bypass_xe_print_alarm = 1"
      as a new entry in the apps tg config file under the XEglobal
      heading, as it could potentially increase simulation speed, as
      alot of information will be printed when logging allocations

    - It is highly recommended that you run your OCR application on the
      nordic cluster as there is currently an issue with the MPI layer on
      FSIM causing a serious simulation slowdown on the foobar cluster


Pre-conditions - Heatmap script
==============

    - TG_ROOT environment variable must be correctly set

    - TG branch must be current enough to include the file
      "xstg-map-decode.c" under <TG_ROOT>/utils/

    - Must SSH into the machine with the -X option to allow
      X-forwarding.  This will allow the visualization
      to load/display


Usage Instructions
==================

    python memoryHeatmap.py <path_to_tg_log_files_parent_directory>

Output
======

    The script will launch a visualization window modelled as follows:

    - Additionally the script will produce a text file summarizing
      the pool size, number of allocations, and number of bytes
      allocated to each memory structure.  More fields may be added
      in the future as needed/requested by the community
